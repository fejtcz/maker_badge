Sample Python code for Maker Badge by [DroneCZ](https://github.com/dronecz).    

My code is based on his [sample code](https://github.com/dronecz/maker_badge) and some parts of the code are inspired by [ah01](https://github.com/ah01/maker_badge_nfc/blob/main/sw/code.py).

## Run on Maker badge
Upload the main file (code.py) to root on the maker badge, that's all :-)

**Button function:**

1) Stop all, and show namecard
2) Turn on LED's with random color (new color by every single touch) 
3) Roll of Dice - Show random number between 1 - 6
4) Not implemented yet
5) Not implemented yet


## Tools
### Namecard generator (./tools/ncgenerator.py)
A simple tool to generate a file for drawing namecards. 
The generated file can be uploaded together with the main script (code.py) directly to root on the maker badge.
